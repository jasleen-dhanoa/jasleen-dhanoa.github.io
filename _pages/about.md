I'm Jasleen Dhanoa, a Research Assistant at the [ScalAR Lab](https://www.grasp.upenn.edu/people/jasleen-kaur-dhanoa/), University of Pennsylvania. My research specializes in Computer Vision, Machine Learning, and Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM). I am deeply passionate about enhancing the efficiency and adaptability of these technologies to advance the capabilities and performance of robots. 

In my free time, I indulge in gardening and enjoy exploring cities on foot. You can find me at my happiest while wandering through a botanical garden. I am also an avid reader and sketch artist, constantly seeking inspiration from the world around me.

If you are interested in learning more about my work or wish to collaborate on a project, please drop me an [email](dhanoajasleen7@gmail.com)!
